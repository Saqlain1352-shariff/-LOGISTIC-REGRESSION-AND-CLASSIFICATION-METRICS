Logistic Regression and Classification Metrics:
Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for binary classification problems, where the outcome is categorical (e.g., yes/no, 0/1). Unlike linear regression, it predicts the probability that a given input point belongs to a certain class. This probability is then transformed into a binary outcome using a threshold, typically 0.5. Logistic Regression is widely used for its simplicity, interpretability, and efficiency.

Classification Metrics are used to evaluate the performance of classification models. Key metrics include:

Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions.
Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made.
Recall (Sensitivity): The proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive cases.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both.
ROC-AUC: The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, indicating the model's ability to distinguish between classes.
These metrics help in assessing how well the model is performing, especially in cases of imbalanced datasets where accuracy alone might be misleading.
